# CueMate

CueMate is a python script that was inspired because vlc would not play wav and flac files that would did not have corresponding unicode characters. this script changes all characters of unsupported codecs in the filenames and the cue file to UTF-8 friendly naming conventions and then organizes the files depending on the album and artist.
